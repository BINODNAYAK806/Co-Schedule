# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Tools and Extensions used :- Font Finder, Color Picker

Collaboration:-GitHub

Overview:-
All in all the task of cloning the co-schedule website was exciting. It as some really cool features which we were excited to implement and learn . And the team played a massive role in helping me achieve my task . We divided our tasks and set daily and periodic goals. We would meet, discuss and find solutions to problems we faced during it.It was a wonderful learning experience. Being a part of a team of motivated individuals brings the best out from us.

The Challenges:-
The first hurdle was to overcome the communication problem, to gel with the team we had a off topic meeting after the work division just to know each other better personally, it helps in knowing each others strengths and weaknesses better.

Conclusion:-
During the course of project building, we develop not only as a coder but also as a coordinator,moderator and problem solver. Problem solving includes deep analytical and communication skills , which can be gained through experience and construct week gives us a perfect platform to experience .

Concluding my blog I would like to give a shout out to my teammates and mentors whose tireless effort and camaraderie made us see through the construct week and coming out with more confidence with this experience.
